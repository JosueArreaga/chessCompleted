# chessCompleted
This project uses 2D arrays to represent the board, Hash Functions for data validation, Stacks to take back plays, Singleton Patterns for data persistence, 
and many algorithms for each piece and its movements derived through cartesian coordinates.

Note: My coding skills have improved drastically from the time of creation. As a result, I will correct common mistakes, such as implementing abstract classes
instead of interfaces and other minor details. To be fixed in July of Summer 2023
